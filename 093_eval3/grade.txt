< As you tiptoe past the sleeping dragon, steam rising from her nostrils, you
< see a gleaming treasure hoard, just beyond the scaly tail.
< 
< An enormous, rare Scythian ruby gleams atop a pedestal, beckoning you.
< You enjoy a quiet evening at home with a mug of herbal tea and your cats,
< who only think they are tiny dragons.
< Your famed sword Ice becomes embedded in the dragon's neck scales, and the
< dragon rolls over, crushing you.
< The ruby is slippery, as though wet, and it glides through your fingers,
< crashing hard into a golden plate, which clatters and crashes like a
< cymbal.
< 
< The dragon wakes up, roasts you like a marshmallow, and eats you whole.
< A mountain of treasure rises before you, but two things are more
< interesting than the sapphires and gold doubloons. To your right, on a
< unique and elegant coat stand, rests a silvery cloak. To your left, atop a
< grand marble desk, lies an ancient book with gold-leaf trim. 
< It appears to be a cloak of invisibility! You pass what should be your hand
< in front of your face, but you see nothing.
< 
< Emboldened, you explore the treasure hoard further.
< The book is the original copy of All of Programming. You pore over its
< contents, internalizing its every lesson.
< 
< Equipped with its knowledge, you sneak back to where the dragon is
< sleeping. 
< You return home, where your cats are very impressed with the Scythian
< ruby. You celebrate your newfound wealth with a party, where you can invite
< all of your friends who have gotten the COVID-19 immunization.
< The book is the original copy of All of Programming, but the text
< disappears as soon as you touch it, apparently an associative property of
< your cloak of invisibility.
< 
< You do not learn to program.
< 
< In your frustration, you let out a long howl of dismay. This wakes the
< dragon, who picks you up gently between her claws and deposits you in a
< shallow pit with a large, craggy egg. You realize with terror that you are
< to be the first meal of her hatchling.
< You return home, where your cats are very impressed with your programming
< abilities.
< 
< So are the recruiters at Smaug, the world's most prestigious dragon
< simulation company. They hire you to be their newest programmer on the
< dragon vision team.
< You wrap the Scythian ruby in the cloak, and sneak back to where the dragon
< slumbers. 
< One bright weekend afternoon, you decide to adventure, putting on your Ring
< of the Niebelungen and traveler's cloak and strapping the famed sword Ice
< to your back.
< 
< Half-way up the mountain Matterhorn, you see a cave opening with steam
< coming out. You enter the cave and tiptoe inside, straining your eyes in
< the gloomy mist.
< 
< You encounter a dragon.
